``Benchopt``
=============

*—Making your optimization benchmarks simple and open—*


|Python 3.6+| |PyPI version| |License|

Benchopt is a benchmarking suite for optimization algorithms.
It is built for simplicity, transparency, and reproducibility.
It is implemented in Python but can run algorithms written in many programming languages.

Reproducing an existing benchmark should be as easy as running

.. prompt:: bash $

   benchopt run . --config ./example_config.yml

There are already many :ref:`available_benchmarks` that have been created using benchopt.
Learn how to run them and how to construct your own with the following pages!
